## What is a strict Content Security Policy?

A Content Security Policy(CSP) is a layer of security that can be added to websites via configuring a
`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header. It helps to mitigate [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).
Usually, CSPs are configured using an allowlist method, which can be [bypassed in most configurations](https://research.google/pubs/csp-is-dead-long-live-csp-on-the-insecurity-of-whitelists-and-the-future-of-content-security-policy/).

A strict CSP doesn't suffer from these vulnerabilities, and is based on nonces (number used once) or hashes, which are generated on the server
and can't be guessed by malicious users.

## Implementing a strict CSP in NextJs SSR and App Router

For server-side rendered pages, creating a strict CSP with a nonce is very simple. We need to generate random nonce for every request,
and set it to the  `x-nonce` header. We are using middlewares for this, as the nonce has to be unique for every request. Note, that for the `script-src`
directive, we also set the policy as `strict-dynamic`, this is essential for blocking scripts and styles that don't have the nonce.

This code is copied straight from the [official nextJs documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy#nonces).

```js title="app/middleware.ts" caption="Implementing a nonce based CSP with NextJs middleware"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString("base64");
  const cspHeader = `
      default-src 'self';
      script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';
      style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';
      img-src 'self' blob: data:;
      font-src 'self';
      object-src 'none';
      base-uri 'self';
      form-action 'self';
      frame-ancestors 'none';
      upgrade-insecure-requests;
  `;
  // Replace newline characters and spaces
  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader
    .replace(/\s{2,}/g, " ")
    .trim();

  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers);
  requestHeaders.set("x-nonce", nonce);

  requestHeaders.set(
    "Content-Security-Policy",
    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue
  );

  const response = NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: requestHeaders,
    },
  });
  response.headers.set(
    "Content-Security-Policy",
    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue
  );

  return response;
}
```

We can also access the nonce from a server component, by reading the headers:

```js title="app/page.tsx"
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const nonce = (await headers()).get('x-nonce')
 
  return (
    <Script
      src="https://my.custom.script-src"
      strategy="afterInteractive"
      nonce={nonce}
    />
  )
}
```

## Implementing a strict CSP in statically rendered pages (SSG)

There is a possibility that server-side rendering does not fulfill the performance requirements of the app, and we still need to set a
strict CSP. In this case, we need to create a unique hash of every inline script that is added to the app, and add it to the CSP. So, a malicious attacker
can't inject new scripts, as their hash won't match the hashes on the CSP.

This is extremely non-trivial, but thankfully, there is an npm package which comes to the rescue: [@next-safe/middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next-safe/middleware).
It will work out of the box for every strict CSP situation, be it SSR (which will add a nonce) or SSG (which will use hashes). Additionaly, it will also 
work for pages that make use of ISR. It will also provide sensible defaults for CSP and other security headers.

This method will only work on apps using the Pages router, as with App Router it's hard to
distinguish what's SSG and what's SSR.

### Setting up

The example configuration below is adapted from the [@next-safe/middleware documentation](https://next-safe-middleware.vercel.app/guides/strict-csp-configuration).
First,Install the package using NPM: `npm i @next-safe/middleware`.

Set up the custom middleware:
```js title="middleware.ts" caption="Setting up the custom middleware"
import {
  chainMatch,
  isPageRequest,
  csp,
  strictDynamic,
  strictInlineStyles,
} from "@next-safe/middleware";

// we can also provide configuration objects to all the function calls
const securityMiddleware = [csp(), strictDynamic(), strictInlineStyles()];

// isPageRequest will make it only match on requests that are for pages, ignoring assets and api calls
export default chainMatch(isPageRequest)(...securityMiddleware);
```

Configure `pages/_document.tsx` to use the custom components with CSP data:

```js title="pages/_document.tsx" caption="Configuring _document.tsx"
import {
  getCspInitialProps,
  provideComponents,
} from "@next-safe/middleware/dist/document";
import Document, { DocumentContext, Html, Main } from "next/document";

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx: DocumentContext) {
    const initialProps = await getCspInitialProps({ ctx });
    return initialProps;
  }

  render() {
    const { Head, NextScript } = provideComponents(this.props);
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

### Usage with GetServerSideProps

For every page that uses GetServerSideProps, we also need to use a custom function wrapper which will inject csp data:

```js title="pages/ssr/index.tsx" caption="Usage with SSR"
import { gsspWithNonce } from "@next-safe/middleware/dist/document";
import { GetServerSideProps, InferGetServerSidePropsType } from "next";

// wrap data fetching with gsspWithNonce
// to generate a nonce for CSP
export const getServerSideProps = gsspWithNonce(async () => {
  return { props: { message: "Hi, from getServerSideProps" } };
}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{
  message: string;
}>;

// the generated nonce also gets injected into page props
const Page = ({
  message,
  nonce,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) => (
  <h1>{`${message}. Nonce ${nonce}`}</h1>
);

export default Page;
```

Now your app will work automatically with both SSG and SSR and properly secure CSP headers.
